One second setup of WordPress development environment with MariaDB, PHP, WordPress, and Nginx on Windows 10
1. Clone this repository or download it as a zip-file and extract the content to your local Windows 10 machine. You get a "start.bat"-script and "tools"-folder. This folder contains the tools needed by the setup.
1. Launch the "start.bat"-script (that is the 1 second task on your side) and see how the script downloads and configures a local WordPress development environment for you.
1. When ready, the script puts the address of the newly created WordPress-site to your clip-board. Paste it to your favorite browser and launch your new WordPress-site.
1. Start developing.
